# OctreeTest

This is a test repository for implementing an octree for oriented bounding-boxes (OBBs).
Right now, only center points of hitbox will be used for choosing the correct octree node. This will be expanded to fit all 8 OBB vertices into the tree.

F1 randomizes the hitboxes (the small black cubes).
